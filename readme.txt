This plugin will allow you to synchronise product info and its stocks from your physical warehouse to you online store. You will be able to save time and money thanks to automating order web management and you will see them from your Point of Sale.

Imagine that you have two physical stores, one in Paris and the other one in Madrid. Even more, you are selling your products through your WooCommerce website around the World. Now you have a new need: you have to upload a new product to every store, including the online one. The normal way would be to upload the product to one store, and then import it to the rest. However, with *WooGlop*, you can upload a product from one Point of Sale station and see it on WooCommerce on the fly.

3. **Tax needs adjusted to Spain**: For being WooCommerce an international software, invoice, tickets, and other stuff management are not adapted 100% to the Spanish Government requirements. With *Glop*, you would have these in the same place.
